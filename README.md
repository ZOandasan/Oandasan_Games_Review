# Oandasan Games Review

### Site Functionality
I wanted to create a site where people could add their favorite PC, Xbox, or Playstation games to my site, and see other people review the games merit, and give a numerical value to it. The scores would be tallied up and presented to all users, so that if they hadn't tried the game, they would have na understanding of peoples opinions of that title.
